### Aegis Intelligence Web App

This was originally a startup idea, but things never go as planned.

"Aegis Intelligence" is a AI Security Software, which was intended to take human error out of Public Security. 

The software which would work natively on a cameras OS, is primarilly coded in Python, with a few files in C++. 

The actual "Web App" which the end company would've used to interact with the camera embedded software is made with ReactJS.

Feel free to contribute and ask questions.
