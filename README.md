### Aegis Intelligence Web App

This was originally a startup idea.

"Aegis Intelligence" is a AI Security Software, which was intended to take human error out of Public Security. 

The software which would work natively on a camera, is primarilly coded in Python, using the OpenCV Library

The actual "Web App" which the end company would've used to interact with the camera embedded software is made with ReactJS.

The API is made with Django, using MongoDB.

Feel free to contribute and ask questions.
