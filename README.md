### Aegis Intelligence Web App

This was originally a startup idea.

"Aegis Intelligence" is a AI Security Software, which was intended to take human error out of Public Security. 

The software which would work natively on a camera, is primarilly coded in Python, using the OpenCV Library

The actual "Web App" which the end company would've used to interact with the camera embedded software is made with ReactJS.

The API is made with Django, using MongoDB.

Feel free to contribute and ask questions.

How to Use.

1.) Clone the Repo


2.) After going into the file directory, open your terminal and use "npm start" to open the web app.


3.) Go into the "AegisAPI" file directory and use your OS Django Start Server command.
- (Windows = "python manage.py runserver OR py manage.py runserver")
- (MacOS/Linx = "python manage.py runserver")

4.) You should now be able to use the Web App and interact with the API.

I'm working on having this all setup on a public .com domain, but this will do for now.
